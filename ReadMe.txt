CREATOR'S NOTE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an assignment to help hone my craft with coding. I fucked around a bit with
some .js and added some partners to this project. The partner page and connected
things was not in the assignment, tho ended up being the one I "wasted" most time
with. Also I tried to style everything in one style.css. That became crazy fast.
Where I use <div></div>, <span></span> etc is at elements of the page where I got
stuck. Ended up capitulating, just defining the divs, working though the problems and
then moving on (Due to the due date). The Parter site etc would neve been created if
not for the extended due date.

Give me feedback please. Only way for me to learn. And I dislike Figma.. Thought you
should know.
